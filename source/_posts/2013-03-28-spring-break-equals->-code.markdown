Today is the first day of my school's Spring break. I'm off until April 7th. Now is when I have to stop thinking and talking about all the great stuff I'm going to get done over the break and start actually doing it. So here's my Spring break checklist:

* Get my "fundraise" Rails app into presentable shape and deploy it to Heroku
* Create a Sinatra app that utilizes either the Twitter or 4Squre API (OR a Rails app that catalogs, retrieves, and displays photo image files based on their embedded EXIF data)
* Start writing tests using Rspec for everything!
* Watch one Code School video each day (Rails, Javascript, GIT)
* Finish reading *Eloquent Ruby*
* Finish reading *Pragmatic Thinking & Learning*
* Revisit my HTML tutorial book to prep for learning Javascript
* Finish my income taxes (Always sucks. Times a million when you owe like my sorry ass.)

Yeah. That's it.

And of course blogging about my progress along the way. (I'll try to keep the cursing to a minimum.)
