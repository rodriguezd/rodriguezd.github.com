Got some great news today!

Yesterday I interviewed for the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/). The school is an intensive, full time, twelve week program meant to turn individuals like myself into "internet swiss army knives". I've had the good fortune to become familiar with the school over the course of its first two sessions. (The second one ends in a couple weeks.) I have visited the school several times, spoken with current students, met with alumni of the first class (all of whom are now working as developers) and they have nothing but great things to say about the school. They give it their full endorsement. All the student presentations I have seen have been very impressive. And I think it's safe to say that the students have had a good time in the process. Intense but fun.

So after the interview yesterday afternoon I began experiencing the mandatory post-interview, second guessing, anxiety inducing, hope-I-didn't-sound-stupid phase wondering how long I would have to wait before I heard anything. I was sure it would be the end of the week at the earliest. I was thankfully mistaken.

12:03 PM today I get an email congratulating me on joining the next Flatiron School semester. What a relief! I was and still am super syked. June 3rd can't get here soon enough. Having said that though, I do have some hefty pre-work to get done. Luckily I've already completed a fair number of the items on the pre-work list. Better for me. I'll have more time to dig in even deeper. I want to be as ready as I can be for this. I want to make sure I squeeze every last drop of knowledge and experience I can out of the school and position myself to knock any prospective employers' socks clean off.

It's game time! Gotta go big or go home.

(I know I'm repeating the following quote from my first post but it's definitely called for here.)
