Today I gave notice at my school that May 31st would be my lasy day there. The following Monday I start the Flatiron School. It was rather nerve wracking. The mental drafts of what to say and how to say it changed every five seconds heading into the appointed time. In the end, I can't even remember exactly what I said. However, I was grateful that the response was very positive. All the administrators I spoke to were very understanding and wished me well. Not that I was really expecting any sort of negative reaction, but the human mind seems to always tasks at least a few neurons to formulating and screening such scenarios.
