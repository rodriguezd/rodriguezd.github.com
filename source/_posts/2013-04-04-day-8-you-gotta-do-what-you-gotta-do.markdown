Today I had to get myself to Stony Brook University for a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) conference my high school wanted me to attend. Not exactly something I was looking forward to doing during my Spring break. They want to start a new program next year and they want me to be one of the teachers. (If you have read my first blog post, you probably picked up on the irony here.) My engineering degree guaranteed that there was no way I wasn't going to be picked for this.

So off to Stony Brook I headed. I took the LIRR for the first time to get there and back. I'm writing this post on the train on my way back to the city. Off peak hours so didn't have seating neighbors. Pretty comfy I have to say. It was nice reading some more *Learning Rails 3* on the way there. Will probably read some *Pragmatic Thinking and Learning* after I'm done here.

The conference itself was 90% boredom with a semi-decent lunch. The only high point was talking to some middle schoolers about the projects they demonstrated. They were so enthusiastic and eager to show you things. They've 3-D printed stuff! How cool is that? Very impressed with them. Wish all middle/high school students were like them.

Tonight I'll be going to the [Flatiron School Presents](http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/events/112427872/?a=md1_grp&rv=md1) meetup. Always a good time combined with great student presentations. Hopefully in the Summer I'll get to do a few myself. ;]
