  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I just finished my third week of the Flatiron School and the experience has been nothing short of fantastic. Hard work, but all worth it. And one of the bonuses of being a student at the school is having guest developer notables come in and share their knowledge, insights, experiences, and excitement about what they do with us.</p>

<p>I thought I would write about what has been a common thread amongst several of their talks, praise for the NYC Ruby/Rails community. I couldn’t agree with them more. My experience with the community began over a year ago with the first Meetup I ever attended. It was a Thursday Hacker Hours hosted by Aidan Feldman (a recent speaker at Flatiron).  Aidan was the first person I met/spoke to at a Meetup. The second person I spoke to, introduced to by Aidan, was Blake Johnson (a current teaching assistant at Flatiron).  After that meetup there have been many others.</p>

<p>Don’t be mistaken, it’s not all about meetups, there are also hackathons, code retreats, happy hours, and conferences where the community congregates to share ideas, stories, knowledge, lessons learned, and sometimes just generally hang out and have a good time with like-minded people. (The occasional free food and beer doesn’t hurt either.) And you never know who you might meet or what you may learn at one of these events. But one thing you can be sure of is that if you need help with something or want to learn more about anything, all you need to do is ask. Don’t be shy. Members of the NYC Ruby/Rails community are always very willing to help and they are extremely welcoming and accepting of those who may just be getting started. It doesn’t matter if you are an aspiring developer or maybe want to turn your “next big thing” idea into a reality.</p>

<p>I have never left a meetup or other community event without having learned something new. Whether it’s about some new Ruby gems, or Rails projects, or development techniques/tools, or lessons learned, or many other things, there is always an opportunity to learn. Sometimes you learn a whole lot! The community can be an invaluable resource for someone who is trying to learn on their own as I was. And all that from experienced programmers who have seen and done it all. Many of whom where at the same point you are at earlier in their careers so they can identify. It’s ok to admit that you’re just a beginner. No one is going to make fun of you. And the more questions you ask the more you will learn. Take advantage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t think so either.</p>

<p>Looking through some presentation decks on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/">speakerdeck.com</a>, I came across two presentations addressing this which I can never can get enough of. The two decks are &#8221;<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/keithrbennett/unix-command-line-productivity-tips">Unix Command Line Productivity Tips</a>&#8221; by Keith Bennet and &#8221;<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/janosgyerik/time-saving-tricks-on-the-command-line">Time-saving tricks on the command line</a>&#8221; by Janos Gyerik.</p>

<p>Following are some of the command line gems I gathered from their presentations. If you are unfamiliar with any of them, I strongly encourage you to try them out. I suspect you will like what you find.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>cd -</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>(The dash is part of the command) Ever find yourself jumping back and forth between two directories? This puppy toggles the current and previous directory.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>pushd</strong> and <strong>popd</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Pushd is short for &#8216;push directory&#8217; and popd for &#8216;pop directory&#8217;. If you execute <strong>&#8216;pushd .&#8217;</strong> and then move to a different directory, you can then execute <strong>&#8216;popd&#8217;</strong> and it will take you back to the directory you pushed previously. How cool is that?!?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>!$</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Not pretty but this captures the last parameter in the previously executed commad. For example, if you <strong>&#8216;touch file.txt&#8217;</strong> and then <strong>&#8216;subl !$&#8217;</strong>, Sublime Text opens <strong>file.txt</strong>.</p>

<h3>For your editing on the commad line pleasure:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>ctrl - w</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Deletes the last word you have entered on the commad line</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ctrl - k</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Deletes from the cursor position to the end of the line</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ctrl - y</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Pastes whatever you deleted in the previous commad</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>cntrl-a</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Jump to the start of the line</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>cntrl - e</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Jump to the end of the line.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>option - left/right</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Skip left/right one word at a time</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I gave notice at my school that May 31st would be my lasy day there. The following Monday I start the Flatiron School. It was rather nerve wracking. The mental drafts of what to say and how to say it changed every five seconds heading into the appointed time. In the end, I can&#8217;t even remember exactly what I said. However, I was grateful that the response was very positive. All the administrators I spoke to were very understanding and wished me well. Not that I was really expecting any sort of negative reaction, but the human mind seems to always tasks at least a few neurons to formulating and screening such scenarios.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the Flatiron pre-work moves along. I&#8217;ve gone through the command line lessons and have moved on to SQL and databases. I worked with SQL some back when I was with Accenture so I hope any residual familiarity that remains kicks in. Really want to get to the HTML and CSS material. Those are areas in which my lack of knowledge greatly frustrates me. Soon enough.</p>

<p>Visited the school tonight to attend one of the sort-of weekly Flatiron Presents meetups. There was a bonus presentation by Lucas Mazza of Plataformatec in Brazil. It felt good to tell some current students who knew I had applied that I had been selected for the next session. Some even invited me to drop by on Saturdays if I wanted any help with the pre-work. They said some of them are always around. I believe it. It was very nice of them to offer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally! The weather is turning for the better. After leaving work today, I actually sat in my hot car in the parking lot for a full minute enjoying the hotness. In a month I&#8217;ll be complaining and reaching for the AC knob but not today. I just wanted to soak it in for a bit. It&#8217;s been a while.</p>

<p>I started working on the Flatiron School pre-work today. It begins with some website &#8220;basics&#8221; which are pretty much just that. I watched several Team Treehouse videos on website basics and aesthetic foundations. Felt like I was in art class for a bit. Lines, shapes, hue, contrast, symmetry, balance, &#8230; Good stuff coming though.</p>

<p>Ended the evening on an extremely pleasant note. Met the girlfriend in the city at NYU where she works, we strolled to McDougal Street to grab some delicious kati rolls to go, and then we headed to Washington Square Park. It was so enjoyable and relaxing sitting there soaking in the beautiful weather and the laid back buzz in the park. Many people walking around, sitting around enjoying what we&#8217;ve all been missing for so long.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got some great news today!</p>

<p>Yesterday I interviewed for the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>. The school is an intensive, full time, twelve week program meant to turn individuals like myself into &#8220;internet swiss army knives&#8221;. I&#8217;ve had the good fortune to become familiar with the school over the course of its first two sessions. (The second one ends in a couple weeks.) I have visited the school several times, spoken with current students, met with alumni of the first class (all of whom are now working as developers) and they have nothing but great things to say about the school. They give it their full endorsement. All the student presentations I have seen have been very impressive. And I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the students have had a good time in the process. Intense but fun.</p>

<p>So after the interview yesterday afternoon I began experiencing the mandatory post-interview, second guessing, anxiety inducing, hope-I-didn&#8217;t-sound-stupid phase wondering how long I would have to wait before I heard anything. I was sure it would be the end of the week at the earliest. I was thankfully mistaken.</p>

<p>12:03 PM today I get an email congratulating me on joining the next Flatiron School semester. What a relief! I was and still am super syked. June 3rd can&#8217;t get here soon enough. Having said that though, I do have some hefty pre-work to get done. Luckily I&#8217;ve already completed a fair number of the items on the pre-work list. Better for me. I&#8217;ll have more time to dig in even deeper. I want to be as ready as I can be for this. I want to make sure I squeeze every last drop of knowledge and experience I can out of the school and position myself to knock any prospective employers&#8217; socks clean off.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s game time! Gotta go big or go home.</p>

<p>(I know I&#8217;m repeating the following quote from my first post but it&#8217;s definitely called for here.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I had to get myself to Stony Brook University for a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) conference my high school wanted me to attend. Not exactly something I was looking forward to doing during my Spring break. They want to start a new program next year and they want me to be one of the teachers. (If you have read my first blog post, you probably picked up on the irony here.) My engineering degree guaranteed that there was no way I wasn&#8217;t going to be picked for this.</p>

<p>So off to Stony Brook I headed. I took the LIRR for the first time to get there and back. I&#8217;m writing this post on the train on my way back to the city. Off peak hours so didn&#8217;t have seating neighbors. Pretty comfy I have to say. It was nice reading some more <em>Learning Rails 3</em> on the way there. Will probably read some <em>Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</em> after I&#8217;m done here.</p>

<p>The conference itself was 90% boredom with a semi-decent lunch. The only high point was talking to some middle schoolers about the projects they demonstrated. They were so enthusiastic and eager to show you things. They&#8217;ve 3-D printed stuff! How cool is that? Very impressed with them. Wish all middle/high school students were like them.</p>

<p>Tonight I&#8217;ll be going to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/events/112427872/?a=md1_grp&amp;rv=md1">Flatiron School Presents</a> meetup. Always a good time combined with great student presentations. Hopefully in the Summer I&#8217;ll get to do a few myself. ;]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it turns out that yesterday I was able to reserve two tickets to the <em>Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em> taping today. Completely unexpected. I checked online and lo and behold there were tickets available. I&#8217;ve never seen that before. My girlfriend and I are big fans so I jumped on it. Very exciting. Kind of an early birthday surprise for the girlfriend since I was hoping to do this very thing around her birthday in May.</p>

<p>Problem with all this is that to pick up the tickets you have to go to the studio, stand outside in line for a couple hours (in the cold and wind mind you), get the tickets, then come back a couple hours later for the taping. That represents a very good chunk of the day. To make matters worse, today was also laundry day. I hate doing the laundry. I don&#8217;t have a washing machine/dryer in my apartment nor is there a laundry room in my building. I have to pack everything up and lug it and myself a couple blocks to the laundromat. It&#8217;s like a two and a half hour process. And I hate every second of it.</p>

<p>Needless to say, between laundry first thing in the morning, trekking up to Hell&#8217;s Kitchen to stand in line for two and a half hours to pick up my ticket, lunch, returning to the studio early so that my girlfriend could pick up her ticket, the show taping (a lot of fun), and then dinner afterwards at a delicious hummus place, I didn&#8217;t get much done today. Only exception was bit of <em>Learning Rails 3</em> reading on the subway and while standing/freezing in line.</p>

<p>C&#8217;est la vie!</p>

<p>And on a big, exciting, positive note, I received an email inviting me to interview for the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>&#8217;s&#8217; summer session. Skype interview on Sunday. Looking forward to it. Keeping fingers crossed. If you don&#8217;t know about the school, check it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I told myself that I was not going to spend more than a half-hour today trying to finish deploying my Help A Cause app on Heroku. That&#8217;s what I told myself. I meant it to. I really did.</p>

<p>I started off reading some from the <em>Learning Rails 3</em> book which I was reading on the subway ride to NYU which is where I was going to be spending the day. (My fiance works at NYU.) I read a couple chapters then started playing an episode of <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/"><em>Ruby Rogues</em></a> and switched back to deploying on Heroku again. That&#8217;s when I became a victim of quick success. I resolved the last issue I was having yesterday pretty quickly and that got me excited thinking I just might be close to it working. (Not really.) And I kept telling myself, &#8220;But maybe this is the last error message before it works!&#8221;.</p>

<p>I discovered (unfortunately not soon enough) that Heroku seems to run through the Rails app migrations sequentially one by one as it tries to build the database in PostgreSQL. Not sure why this is the way it does it but it just does. There has to be a better way. What was causing me problems was that every time Heroku came across a migration that did something that PostgreSQL did not like, it would puke some cryptic error about some DB incompatibility that most likely did not actually exist in my database any more. It existed in that particular migration it was trying to execute at the time but not in the current schema. Heroku was making me pay for offenses my db commited in its youth. So eventually I figured out that if I deleted the offending migration file and re-ran the migration, Heroku would get further before finding the next migration it didn&#8217;t care for. Eventually I got it to finish the migration and Walla! the app came online.</p>

<p>Had lunch and afterwards joined my girlfriend in visiting a restaurant we&#8217;re considering for our post-wedding dinner. Not happening til August 2014 but you can never start planning too soon.</p>

<p>After getting back, I decided to try to populate the production database with the data I had in my development database so I had something to work with. Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard. All it should take is &#8220;heroku db:push&#8221;, right? I entered the command, hit enter, and then a few seconds later I learned that Heroku wasn&#8217;t done with me yet. &#8220;Time zone displacement out of range.&#8221; Just rolls off the tongue doesn&#8217;t it? Whatever was going on it caused the push to fail and the app to crash to boot. So I hit Google and Stack Overflow and tried to figure out what in the world this error might mean.</p>

<p>Long story short, I came across a proposed solution which I found hard to believe. You&#8217;re gonna love this. The proposed solution was to switch to Ruby 1.9.2, reinstall the necessary gems, conduct the push, and then switch back to Ruby 1.9.3. Seriously? With great skepticism I tried it and wouldn&#8217;t you know it, it worked. Apparently there&#8217;s something about the Heroku db that is incompatible with Ruby 1.9.3. So the only way to get the data push to work is to use 1.9.2. Wow. But everything worked after that.</p>

<p>I ended the day looking into Sinatra. I installed the gem and created and ran my first, basic-as-it-gets Sinatra app. Looks pretty interesting. Can&#8217;t wait to learn more.</p>
